## Developer Notes

* Following information is expected to be available and accurate in a file named .env with values different than the
  ones shown:

```text
MONGODB_CONNECTION_TEMPLATE='fmorrison-learning.vemxm.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=FMORRISON-LEARNING&authSource=admin'
MONGODB_UID='' <--- fill in your super user ID
MONGODB_PWD='' <--- fill in your super user password
DB_USER=<db_password>@fmorrison-learning.vemxm.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=FMORRISON-LEARNING
MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME='sample_analytics' <--- This program expects you have pulled in the free MongoDB sample databases
MONGODB_COLLECTION_NAME='customers'      <--- This program expects you have pulled in the free MongoDB sample collections
```

* since many MongoDB collections have an _id field, I created a parent class named `MongoDbBaseModel` to make it easier
  to handle working with that field,
  especially when creating new records by copying existing ones that will need a different unique id from the one they
  were copied from.
